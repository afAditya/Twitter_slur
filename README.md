# Twitter_slur

Ques : Imagine there is a file full of Twitter tweets by various users and you are provided a set of words that indicates racial slurs. Write a program that can indicate the degree of profanity for each sentence in the file.

Sol : 

I have created different lists containing slurs and they will have a level of profanity assigned with them
so if user like want to know there tweet profanity
I will first split tweet word by word
then i will search that word in the above lists if found
i will tell level of profanity to user and
if not then there is no profanity

So this is a add on to program that could be done
so if the word is not been found in my lists but
is a slur then i can ask the user like if it is a slur
and the level of the slur and then i can add it 
to my lists.
